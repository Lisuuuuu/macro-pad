# September 8th: Started the work!

  Read about pcb, keyboards

  Made the first version of a schematic 
    -9 key pad using switch matrix
    - and used an arduino pro micro


**Total time spent: 1.5h**


# September 9th: Rebuild!

   Rebuilt the whole project now using a pi pico, 4 switches without matrix just direct wiring( found out the matrix was an over kill for just 4 keys and with 9 keys it wouldn't be possible to keep it slim like i wanted to. Added an oled display and a rotary encoder.

**Total time spent: 1h**


# September 10th: The case

  Learnt how to use fusion 360 and made the case for the pcb

**Total time spent: 1h**

# September 13th: Finishing

  I run the drc on the board ang got 30 errors -_-. I rearranged the pcb and rerouted it and made an another case for it.

**Total time spent: 1h**
